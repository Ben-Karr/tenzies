# Tenzies
![winning game screenshot](./win_screenshot.png)

A React App that lets you play the dice game of __Tenzi__. This is the final project of the great [React Course - Beginner's Tutorial for React JavaScript Library](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8) by [Bob Ziroll](twitter.com/bobziroll). I added a "Roll Counter" and local state that lets you save the "LowScore". The app is deployed at [___]().
